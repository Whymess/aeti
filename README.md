# XXXXX Front-End Homework Problem README:

Welcome to the XXXXX interview process!

This is a very basic React demo app, designed to get an idea of your approach to frontend problem-solving, as well as your understanding of data flow and event systems in rich JavaScript frameworks/libraries (we are using React for this test, but similar principles apply in Angular, Vue, or other frameworks).

The app is simply a top-level app.js container with a few child components (ButtonColorful, TextInput, and VideoPlayer).

Please follow the directions in each of the three components (via the comments at the top of each file) to fix bugs and/or implement the requested features.

Focus on writing clean, well-documented code that demonstrates and explains your thought process and solutions. If you get stuck on a specific bug, please leave inline comments with the strategies you tried, and why they did/did not help move toward a solution.

Good luck!

Tips:

 - You shouldn't need to add any new dependencies (a `react-youtube` module is already included for `VideoPlayer`), but feel free to add other libraries if you believe they add value to your workflow or solution.
 - Visual design won't be scored as part of this exercise, but if you see opportunities to refactor or streamline the component styling, go for it!
 - The exercise should take 60-75 minutes at most. It's specifically designed to be respectful of your time and energy.
